    <p align="left">"Close your eyes." he croaked, I did as I was told without any disobedience. "Have you any idea how badly I want to kiss you right now?" I shook my head in reply. "Badly, so fucking badly." he whispered as his harsh breath fanned across my cheek. 

        Dark haired and tattooed, Xavier looked like the ultimate bad boy...but weren't bad boys meant to have that boyish charm? The thing is, Xavier was extremely guarded, hot headed and quite frankly, scary. 
        
        In fact, Xavier was many things but romantic and loving wasn't two of them. He was a building half built, a puzzle with half of the pieces missing...

        She was broken
        So she moved away 
        Until one day
